# Welcome To My Portfolio Website

I am Abheelash, a full-stack developer currently in my pre-final year at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. My interest in computer science dates back to my childhood, where I found computers to be captivating. I have always possessed a passion for problem-solving, which ultimately led me to pursue a career in this field.

My journey into web development was driven by my fascination with designing backend architectures, particularly in the realm of DevOps. I find it to be one of the more enjoyable aspects of coding and development.

In terms of my technical expertise, I specialize in utilizing React.js for frontend development, occasionally incorporating Three.js to enhance the visual appeal of websites. For backend development, I rely on Node.js or Django to power my applications. I am currently experimenting with Next.js and have found it to be a valuable addition to my skill set.

Furthermore, I am actively exploring technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, as well as cloud infrastructures like Amazon Web Services, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and Google Cloud Platform. I take pride in my ability to adapt quickly to new technologies and possess strong problem-solving and debugging skills. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of computer fundamentals, which enables me to navigate diverse tech stacks effectively.

As for now, I am currently an intern for Samsung R&D Institute in their PRISM program where we are working on developing a CNN model that can take monochrome images and low-light images, and output a high-quality, well-lit image.

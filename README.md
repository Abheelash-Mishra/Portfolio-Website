# Welcome To My Portfolio Website

Hey everyone! I am Abheelash Mishra, a full-stack developer currently in my final year at SRMIST and am currently interning at Baton Systems as a software engineer. I chose computer science as I found computers fascinating as a kid, and I always did love solving a good problem! I figured I should dabble in web development as designing the backend architecture is some of the most fun I have had in coding!

As for my tech stack, I utilize React.js for my frontend, alongside with Three.js occasionally, to create visually stunning sites. As for my backend, I use Node.js or Spring frameworks to power my application. Next.js has been been great too! I am also familiar Docker, alongside with cloud infrastructures such as Amazon Web Services, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and Google Cloud Platform. I am a strong problem solver and debugger, quickly adaptable to new tech stacks that I have not used before, and am well-versed in my computer fundamentals.
